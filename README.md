In the Figma design, I did not see a responsive design for mobile devices, but the design is responsive and adapts to all screen sizes, including large screens like 1920x1080. However, there are some dimensions that I couldn't fully adjust for larger screens since the measurements in Figma are for screens 1440px wide. Nonetheless, the design looks perfect at the screen resolution proposed in Figma.

The font family specified in Figma was not available, so I used very similar fonts from Google Fonts.
